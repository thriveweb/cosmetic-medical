      Crooked or abnormally arranged teeth can be associated with oral health
      risks. Braces and orthodontics can be used to align the teeth and
      eliminate any problems that may be present while eating, speaking or
      practicing dental hygiene. At Teeth on Ferry our dedicated team provides
      developmental screening for all children to identify the need for
      orthodontics at an early age.

      Injuries to the teeth, jaw and gums are relatively common in children and
      their effects can be catastrophic to their proper development. Good habits
      for use of protective equipment such as a mouthguard should commence as
      soon as children start participating in organised sport.

      Wisdom teeth only require removal if they are causing, or are likely to
      cause, problems. If the tooth is impacted (partially emerged), food may
      become trapped around the tooth. This can lead to decay, gum disease,
      cellulitis, abscesses, cysts and benign growths. Antibiotics and
      antiseptic mouthwash may treat these problems, though removal of the tooth
      is often necessary.

      Children should attend their first dental check up at the age of 2 years.
      The initial visit and annual follow up appointments should focus on
      familiarisation with both the equipment and the dentist in order to build
      trust. This is recommended until the child is comfortable with the dentist
      examining and cleaning their teeth.

      A regular check up enables your dentist to find and address current oral
      health and dental issues, discuss planned treatment and prevent more
      serious issues from developing. This reduces the risk of expensive or
      extensive dental treatment.

      Dentist intervention is often easier, faster and less expensive when
      issues are identified early. Regular examinations including developmental
      screening are recommended from age 2 onwards.
