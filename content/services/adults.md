      A regular check up enables your dentist to find and address current oral
      health and dental issues, discuss planned treatment and prevent more
      serious issues from developing. This reduces the risk of expensive or
      extensive dental treatment. The average check up and clean requires at
      least 30 minutes, though a thorough examination may take up to 90 minutes.

      A crown is an artificial restoration that covers the remaining part of a
      tooth that has been professionally prepared. Crowns are used to repair and
      strengthen damaged teeth and to improve the appearance of a tooth
      including shape, colour and apparent alignment. Bridges are used to
      replace missing teeth.

      Technically, the implant itself refers only to the titanium screw. This
      screw is secured into the jaw, acting as an artificial tooth root. This
      provides the support for the abutment and crown that form the rest of the
      prosthetic tooth. A dental implant, if taken care of properly, is expected
      to last upwards of forty years.

      Root Canal treatments eliminate pain caused by infection in the tooth,
      allowing the area to remain healthy and for the tooth to be retained for
      many years. Root Canal treatment may be necessary if the tissue that
      supplies blood and nerve endings to the tooth becomes infected, inflamed
      or has severe swelling.

      As a result of decay, infection or trauma, the tooth may need to be
      extracted to prevent further health complications. A tooth may also be
      extracted due to overcrowding of the mouth to prepare for orthodontics.

      Teeth whitening is an effective way to lighten the natural colour of the
      teeth after staining caused by tea, coffee, some foods and tobacco; as
      well as general wear and tear. Whitening teeth is a great option for those
      looking to boost their confidence and self-esteem with a brilliant, white
      smile.
