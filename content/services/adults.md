      A regular check up enables your dentist to find and address current oral
      health and dental issues, discuss planned treatment and prevent more
      serious issues from developing. This reduces the risk of expensive or
      extensive dental treatment. The average check up and clean requires at
      least 30 minutes, though a thorough examination may take up to 90 minutes.

      A crown is an artificial restoration that covers the remaining part of a
      tooth that has been professionally prepared. Crowns are used to repair and
      strengthen damaged teeth and to improve the appearance of a tooth
      including shape, colour and apparent alignment. Bridges are used to
      replace missing teeth.

      Technically, the implant itself refers only to the titanium screw. This
      screw is secured into the jaw, acting as an artificial tooth root. This
      provides the support for the abutment and crown that form the rest of the
      prosthetic tooth. A dental implant, if taken care of properly, is expected
      to last upwards of forty years.

      Root Canal treatments eliminate pain caused by infection in the tooth,
      allowing the area to remain healthy and for the tooth to be retained for
      many years. Root Canal treatment may be necessary if the tissue that
      supplies blood and nerve endings to the tooth becomes infected, inflamed
      or has severe swelling.

      As a result of decay, infection or trauma, the tooth may need to be
      extracted to prevent further health complications. A tooth may also be
      extracted due to overcrowding of the mouth to prepare for orthodontics.

      well as general wear and tear. Whitening teeth is a great option for those
      looking to boost their confidence and self-esteem with a brilliant, white

      PRP definition - a platelet concentration higher than the physiologic
      platelet concentration found in healthy whole blood.


      PRP is often injected into areas within the body that have a poor blood
      supply to promote healing in these difficult to heal areas. PRP treatments
      are often used to treat healing and pain problems that have not responded
      to standard treatment approaches. In dermatology and cosmetic medicine,
      PRP has been successfully used to treat acne, scarring, skin rejuvenation.
      In hair restoration, PRP will be injected into the scalp. The application
      of PRP causes miniaturized hair follicles to become healthier and larger,
      producing more robust hair growth. PRP activates follicular progenitor
      cells (adult stem cells) and promotes angiogenesis and localised cell
      growth. Effective for both male and female pattern hair loss, PRP has also
      regrown hair in alopecia area, eyebrow hypotrichosis and other patient
      cases with non-hereditary hair loss. The PRP treatment is performed in a
      doctorâ€™s office and usually the procedure can be completed within one
      hour.
